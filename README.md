# SimpleAppNYT
  SimpleAppNYT is built using the New York Times API. In particular, the following were used (https://developer.nytimes.com/apis):
1) Archive API (Get all NYT article metadata for a given month);
2) Article Search API (Search for New York Times articles);
3) Books API (Get NYT Best Sellers Lists and lookup book reviews);
4) Most Popular API (Popular articles on NYTimes.com);
5) Movie Reviews API (Search for movie reviews);
6) Times Wire API (Real-time feed of NYT article publishes);
7) Top Stories API (Get articles currently on a section front or the home page).

  In order to use you need to get an API key. Receiving instructions: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started
